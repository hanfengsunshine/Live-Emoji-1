For centuries it was the home of Tibetan and Quiang groups, but until the 1970s few others visited this area on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau in Sichuan province. Today, you can hike its virgin woodlands and view striking multi-level waterfalls. You might even see a giant panda or two.\n\nJiuzhaigou National Park\n\nThe valley of Jiuzhaigou—the word means “Nine Village Valley” in Chinese—is named for the nine Tibetan villages that lie within it. But the national park that was created in the area is especially famous for numerous colorful lakes, multi-level waterfalls, and snow-capped mountain peaks. The park, located in the Chinese province of Sichuan, was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 and a World Biosphere Reserve in 1997.\n\nPeacock Riverbed\n\nThe Peacock Riverbed lies at the north end of Five Flower Lake. From there the water flows north into the forest to Golden Bell Lake.\n\nNuo Ri Lang Waterfall\n\nAt 1,050 feet (320 m) wide, Nuo Ri Lang is the widest travertine-topped waterfall in the world. Travertine is a special type of limestone. It forms when calcium carbonate is deposited by hot mineral springs and builds up into layered sedimentary rock. The travertine partially dams water behind it, which flows over the rock in cascades. Lush plants grow atop the rock. In the morning, rainbows often arc over Nuo Ri Lang. In winter the falls turn into a curtain of ice, and their sound is silenced.\n","graph":{"last_node_id":70,"last_link_id":45,"nodes":[{"id":9,"type":"node_editor/keyboard_number","pos":[-1143.0438669999978,986.6757159999989],"size":{"0":210,"1":51},"flags":{},"mode":0,"outputs":[{"name":"","type":-1,"links":[3]}],"properties":{"key":"3"}},{"id":11,"type":"node_editor/keyboard_number","pos":[-1151.0438669999978,1127.6757159999993],"size":{"0":210,"1":51},"flags":{},"mode":0,"outputs":[{"name":"","type":-1,"links":[4]}],"properties":{"key":"4"}},{"id":13,"type":"node_editor/keyboard_number","pos":[-1151.0438669999978,1272.6757159999993],"size":{"0":210,"1":51},"flags":{},"mode":0,"outputs":[{"name":"","type":-1,"links":[5]}],"properties":{"key":"5"}},{"id":14,"type":"node_editor/keyboard_number","pos":[-1159.043866999998,1385.6757159999995],"size":{"0":210,"1":51},"flags":{},"mode":0,"outputs":[{"name":"","type":-1,"links":[6]}],"properties":{"key":"6"}},{"id":28,"type":"node_editor/sound","pos":[-330.3879291264418,-91.05189082726812],"size":{"0":210,"1":51},"flags":{},"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":-1,"link":16}],"properties":{"sound":"laugh","play":""}},{"id":27,"type":"node_editor/anchor","pos":[-319.3879291264418,54.94810917273192],"size":{"0":210,"1":177},"flags":{},"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"trigger","type":-1,"link":15},{"name":"attraction1","link":null},{"name":"attraction2","link":null}],"properties":{"anchor":"center","direction":"top

The Nabataeans, a desert people, carved by hand thousands of rose-colored temples, dwellings, and tombs into the red sandstone landscape. At the height of Nabataean influence in A.D. 50, the population of this city, their capital, swelled to more than 20,000. It had become an international epicenter of the spice, silk, and incense trade.\n\nThe Khaznah\n\nBuilt to a grand scale during the reign of Nabataean King Aretas IV (9 B.C.–A.D. 40), the massive rock-carved Al Khazneh (“The Treasury”) stands about 23 meters wide and 30 meters high. Scholars believe the structure served as a temple and may also have been intended to intimidate traders from other nations as they peddled their wares in Petra’s market. Many of its architectural elements show the influence of Greek design on Nabataean architecture.\n\nInside the Temple\n\nScholars believe these small rooms were made to entomb the Nabataean king, Aretas IV. About 300 years after his death Petra was on a downhill slide due to outside changes to trade routes. Historical references to the city and its people all but disappear after Muslim Arabs arrived in the early 600s.
